### Frontend

The Apps frontend is built using the React JavaScript library.
It is responsible for creating an interface for the user to interact with the application. It will be responsible for rendering the user interface, handling user input, and making requests to the backend server.

### Backend

The backend of the application is built using the Express framework for Node.js. It is responsible for handling requests from the frontend, interacting with the database, and returning responses to the frontend.

### Database

The database for the application is built using MongoDB & AWS. It is responsible for storing all the data for the application, including user accounts, event listings, and profile pictures(AWS). The database will be accessed by the backend server via the Mongoose ODM.

## Wireframes
### Log in/sign up flow
- The first page a user will see is the home page which will contain a number of components that are not dependent on the user being logged in. From this page a user can choose to sign up or log in to an existing account.

- Upon signing up or logging in, a user will then have access to their profile screen and can make customisations such as adding in a profile picture, adding in their top 5 anime/characters as well as viewing any upcoming events they have RSVP'd to.

![Log in flow](./docs/Wireframe/login-signup-flow.png)

### App flow
- From the home page, users will be presented with a calendar widget showing the current month and any events that are scheduled will be highlighted within this calendar. Additionally, a list view of the upcoming events will be shown to the user.

- Clicking onto an event from the calender or upcoming events widget will take the user directly to the event information page where they can log their interest in the event by clicking 'Interested' or 'Not for me'.

- The navigation bar will have an 'All events' link which will take the user to the events landing page. This page will contain a list of all the events posted to the platform and will have filter options giving users the ability to find events that fit their criteria.

- Clicking onto any events on the event landing page will direct users to the event page where all the event information will be shown. Users can RSVP from this page.

- The navigation bar will have a 'Create event' link which will only be available to authorised users (i.e. users who have been flagged as 'Organisers' by the Admins) and will take the user to a form allowing them to create a new event listing or edit an existing listing if it already exists. Once the event is published it will appear on the platform and will be available for users to view.

### Home page - Content prioritisation

- The application's first and foremost goal is to be intuitive and easy for the user to decide whether or not they would like to attend an event. Given this purpose: 
    1. The first priority that a user would like to see would be a calendar so the user could quickly check whether or not any event timings would fit into their schedule. 
    1. The second priority would be a written list of upcoming events which would provide more information such as the type of event happening (anime movie screening, anime episode marathon, meet & greet, anime convention) and the location in an attempt to further catch the user's interest.
    1. The third priority would be a list of upcoming animeswhich would also serve as a way to catch the user's interest.
    1. The fourth priority would be an weekly poll that would serve to drive engagement and give the organiser's some feedback as to what events the users would like to see next.

- This application is being built following the 'mobile-first' concept, and hence the order of the components follows our specified priority in mobile view. In desktop and tablet mode, the device will have additional screen space and hence priority 3 and 4 items are pushed to the sidebar.
![Home page content prioritisation](./docs/Wireframe/homepage-priority.png)

### Event page - Content prioritisation
- Upon entering the event page our content is laid out based on the following justifications:
    1. The user will need confirmation of the anime event they would like to attend, hence priority #1 is the anime name and title screen.
    1. The user will need more information about the event such as the location, the event type, the date and any other pertinent information hence priority #2 is the information box
    1. The RSVP buttons are priority #3 and act as a call to action for the user to log their interest in the event. It has been placed high up in the event page so that the user is instantly reminded that they can RSVP to the event.
    1. The maps view is priority #4 which is an addition to the information box. Users may already be familiar with the location and hence the maps widget ranks lower in terms of priority.

- Much like the home page, our content in mobile view reflects our specified order of priority in a vertical layout, whilst in desktop/tablet view the components are nested next to each other due to the increased screen availability.

## Trello Board

Our team decided to utilise [Trello](https://trello.com/) for the project management and planning methodology. Each task was delegated an owner, as represented by the profile photos in the bottom right of each card. Each card also had a start date and desired completed date that gave enough lead time.

For Part A of the assessment, 2024-02-12 marked the first day of planning and delegating tasks. Screenshots of the Trello board were taken daily at approximately 5pm, besides 2024-02-13 where no significant changes were made and on 2024-02-17 when two screenshots were taken as significant progress was made from morning to evening.
